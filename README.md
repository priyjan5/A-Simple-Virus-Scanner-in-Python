# A-Simple-Virus-Scanner-in-Python
1.  The Scanner Program runs with a specified starting point i.e.; a directory path and a file consisting of signatures.
2.	The program examines recursively all files and subdirectories in the directory specified. 
3.	For each file, the program tests if it contains a binary substring that matches a signature listed in the input file.  
4.	The output of the program indicates which files in the directory contain which signatures in the list.
